# House Listings Web Application as a part of DTT_Frontend_Assessment

This web application allows users to:

- View a list of houses that are currently available for sale.
- Create, edit, and delete their own listings. 
- Like a house and add it to their list of favorites.
- View the history of houses they have previously viewed.
- Access a new page to see all of their listings.
- Receive recommendations on the detail page.
- Read information about the web app and the developer on the "About" page.

The project is built using Vite. To complete this assessment, I had to learn a new framework - Vue, along with the state management library Vuex, as my previous experience was primarily with React.js and Redux Toolkit to manage state. 


## Getting Started

To run the project locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev -- --port 8080
