# House Listings Web Application as a part of DTT Frontend Assessment

This web application allows users to:

- View a list of houses that are currently available for sale.
- Create, edit, and delete their own listings. 
- Search houses by different criteria.
- Sort all houses by price and size.
- Like a house and add it to their list of favorites.
- View the history of houses they have previously viewed.
- Access a new page to see all of their listings.
- Receive recommendations on the detail page (sorted by price difference to the selected house).
- Read information about the web app and the developer on the "About" page.

The data is fetched from a remote source, using existing API. The API is documented in detail [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/12962311/2s93m4WhXN#85344c71-e504-4432-a2e9-349b9941f269).

The project is built using Vite. To complete this assessment, I had to learn a new framework - Vue, along with the state management library Vuex, as my previous experience was primarily with React.js and Redux Toolkit to manage state. 


## Getting Started

To run the project locally, use the following command from my-vue-app:

```bash
npm run dev
